                        Scope, Eligibility, and Modification of Terms
                    </h2>
                    <p>SheDrives is a technology platform that connects independent drivers with Passenger. SheDrives does not provide transportation, logistics, or any related services directly ("Services"). Decisions to offer or accept Services are
                         made independently by users at their own discretion and risk. SheDrives does not direct or control drivers in their provision of these Services, and any feature or process provided to enhance the user experience is not indicative of an employment or agency relationship with any user.</p>
                    <p class="my-2">These Terms do not override or impact the enforceability of any agreements that Passenger may have with drivers regarding the Services.
                    </p>
                    <p>SheDrives acts as a platform linking independent third-party providers of transportation services ("Drivers") with their Passenger ("Passenger"). When a Passenger requests a ride or bike service, they propose a price for the Driver’s services. Drivers who see the request can either accept the offered price or make a counteroffer. Passenger are free to choose a Driver from the list of those who have shown interest in accepting the request. A separate agreement is formed between
                     the Driver and the Passenger when the Passenger confirms the ride or service.</p>
                    <p>Passenger are responsible for paying the agreed-upon price to the Driver, which includes all associated charges (e.g., fees, tolls, taxes, etc.). SheDrives does not participate in or influence the
                        financial settlement between the Driver and the Passenger.</p>
                    <p class="my-2">SheDrives does not provide transportation or bike services directly.</p>
                    <p>SheDrives may modify any part of these Terms at any time. When changes are made, they will take effect on the "Last Updated" date noted at the top of this page. Continued use of the Platform after such notice will constitute acceptance of the updated Terms.
                    </p>

                    <p>SheDrives enables communication between users through the Platform, including comments, in-app chat, or in-app calls (depending on location). We reserve the right to monitor and record your communications to ensure compliance with these Terms.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Payment Transactions</h2>
                    <h3>General Terms</h3>
                    <p><b>Offer and Acceptance:</b> Through the Platform, Passenger can propose a fare for a specific route or courier service. When a Driver accepts this offer, it forms a contract where the Driver will provide the service for the agreed price. Drivers can counter the offer with a new fare, and if the Passenger accepts
                       this counteroffer, it forms a contract for the new fare.</p>
                    <p><b>Payment System:</b> The SheDrives payment system allows Passenger to suggest a fare for a ride or courier service, and the request is confirmed only if both the Passenger and Driver agree on the price.</p>
                    <p><b>Account Information:</b> Drivers and Passenger must provide and maintain valid credit/debit card information and bank account details in their SheDrives Account to request and accept services. Drivers must have a valid bank account to use the Platform and accept requests.</p>
                    <p><b>Payment Authorization:</b> By providing your payment details, you authorize us or our payment processor to charge your designated payment method. Only valid payment methods specified by us may be used.</p>

                    <p><b>Recommended Price:</b> SheDrives may provide a recommended price based on the time and area of the request. This is for informational purposes and does not bind Passenger or Drivers to that price.</p>
                    <p><b>Charges:</b> Drivers and Passenger are responsible for paying all charges incurred through the Platform, which are in Pakistani Rupees (RS) and include applicable taxes.</p>

                    <p><b>Authorization Hold:</b> We may place a temporary authorization hold to verify the validity of a Passenger’s payment method. No money is debited, but funds are placed on hold. If your primary payment method is invalid, we may use a secondary payment method if available, or contact you. If the hold is canceled and payment is not processed, you must complete the payment again to continue using the Platform.</p>
                    <p><b>Service Charges:</b> Using the Platform may result in charges for the agreed-upon price. Payments to Drivers are considered as direct payments from the Passenger. Payments are due immediately and will be facilitated using the payment method on your Account. Receipts or tax invoices are available through the Platform.</p>
                    <p><b>Tips:</b> You may provide additional payment as a tip to a Driver, but it is not mandatory.</p>
                    <p><b>Waiting Fees:</b> If a Driver waits for the Passenger beyond a certain time, a waiting fee will be added to the agreed price. Waiting fees are in favor of the Driver and are not income for SheDrives. Outstanding waiting fees must be paid before requesting new services. Individuals with disabilities can request
                       a refund or waiver of waiting fees by contacting Support.</p>
                    <p><b>Cancellation or No-Show Fees:</b> You may be charged a cancellation or no-show fee if you cancel after the Driver has waited at the pickup location or do not show up. Fees vary by location and will be shown before confirmation. Cancellation fees are in favor of the Driver and not income for SheDrives. If the cancellation is not due to your fault, you may be eligible for a refund.
                       An Operational Fee may apply to the Cancellation Fee.</p>

                    <p><b>Refunds:</b> Quoted prices and charges such as cancellation, waiting, and no-show fees are final and non-refundable unless determined by SheDrives's Refund Policy or required by law.</p>

                    <p><b>Electronic Wallet and Transfers:</b> Payments for completed rides or courier services are maintained in an electronic wallet ("Wallet") within the Platform. Drivers can request transfers to their designated bank account or opt for automatic transfers. Accurate banking details are essential, and SheDrives is not responsible for issues resulting from inaccurate details or technical glitches. Without a verified bank account, earnings can only be received as specified.</p>
                    <p><b>Technical Glitches:</b> If a Technical Glitch causes incorrect transactions to your Wallet, SheDrives may correct these transactions and adjust your Wallet balance accordingly. If SheDrives cannot correct the transactions, future earnings may be adjusted until the balance is accurate. SheDrives can seek restitution through legal means if necessary.</p>
                    <p><b>Tax Responsibilities:</b> Drivers are responsible for collecting and remitting all income-based taxes, including self-employment taxes. SheDrives is not accountable for any tax-related misconduct. Monthly tax summaries are available on the Platform.</p>
                    <p><b>Tax Credits and Deductions:</b> Drivers should assist SheDrives in claiming or verifying any applicable tax credits, set-offs, rebates, or refunds.

                    <p><b>License Fee:</b> SheDrives may charge a license fee for using the Platform, detailed in the Terms of Payment. This fee is charged when the vehicle arrives at the pickup point or when contacting the Passenger before marking arrival.</p>
                    <p><b>Refunds to Drivers:</b> Refunds may be available for canceled or no-show rides, including the SheDrives license fee. Refunds will be processed within 30 days of confirmation. For no-show rides, select "The passenger didn't come out" in the App.</p>
                    <p><b>Refunds to Passenger:</b> If a Passenger disputes a service and a refund is issued, it will be processed on the Driver’s behalf. The Driver's Account may show a negative balance, and SheDrives may deduct the amount owed from future earnings. SheDrives may contact the Driver regarding outstanding payments.</p>


                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Forfeiture Terms</h2>
                    <p><b>Account Deletion:</b> Accounts inactive for over 3 years may be deleted. If an account with a positive balance is deleted, drivers have 6 months to request a withdrawal of funds. Unclaimed funds after this period will be deducted in favor of SheDrives. Requests for withdrawal can be made through the Refund Policy statement on the support page.</p>

                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes</h2>
                    <p><b>1. Arbitration Overview:</b>Arbitration is a method for resolving disputes more quickly and cost-effectively than traditional court proceedings. By agreeing to arbitration, you waive your right to a trial by judge or jury. Arbitration is binding, meaning the arbitrator’s decision is final.</p>
                    <p><b>2. Scope of Arbitration:</b>This Agreement covers all past, present, and future legal disputes and claims between you and SheDrives, including those related to bodily injury, personal injury, property damage, and any other issues arising out of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, Additional Terms,
                       or your use of SheDrives’s services.</p>
                    <p><b>Supersession:</b>: If any other arbitration agreement applies, this Agreement will supersede it.</p>
                    <p><b>Third-Party Disputes: </b>This Agreement also covers disputes involving SheDrives’s officers, directors, employees, or affiliates if SheDrives could be indirectly liable.</p>
                    <p><b>Multiple Disputes: </b>All disputes should be resolved in a single arbitration.</p>
                    <p><b>Emergency Relief: </b>You or SheDrives may seek emergency or temporary injunctive relief if necessary.</p>
                    <p><b>Administrative Remedies: </b>For claims requiring administrative remedies, you must exhaust those remedies before initiating arbitration.</p>
                    <p><b>3. No Substitution for Internal Procedures:</b>This Agreement does not prevent you from using SheDrives’s internal procedures for resolving complaints before seeking arbitration.</p>
                    <p><b>4. No Retaliation:</b>You will not be retaliated against for challenging the validity of this Agreement or filing claims with administrative agencies.</p>


                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Claims in Individual Capacity Only</h2>
                    <p><b>1. Prohibition on Class Actions:</b>You and SheDrives agree that any disputes will be handled individually. Neither party can:</p>
                    <p>File, join, opt into, or become part of any lawsuit or court case related to a dispute.</p>
                    <p>Participate in any class, collective, representative, or aggregate lawsuit, court case, or arbitration related to a dispute.</p>
                    <p><b>2. No Class, Collective, Representative, or Aggregate Basis:</b>Disputes must be brought and resolved on an individual basis only. No class, collective, representative, or aggregate proceedings are permitted.</p>
                    <p><b>3. Arbitrator Authority:</b>The arbitrator cannot consolidate claims from multiple parties, nor can they preside over any class, collective, representative, or aggregate arbitration. Claims from more than one person or entity cannot be joined or consolidated.</p>
                    <p><b>4. Invalidity of Section III:</b>If Section III (Class Action Waiver) is challenged, only a court of competent jurisdiction—not an arbitrator—can decide its validity.</p>


                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">How Arbitration Works</h2>
                    <h3>1. Notice of Dispute:</h3>
                    <p><b>To initiate a dispute:</b></p>
                    <p><b>Step 1:</b>: Submit a “Notice of Dispute” with supporting documents or information to SheDrives’s support page or by mail to UG-41 Eden Tower Gulberg 3 Lahore. The notice must include your name, address, contact information, email address, details of the dispute, and the relief you are seeking.</p>
                    <p><b>Step 2:</b>: If SheDrives initiates a dispute, they will send a notice to your last known address or email. Both parties will attempt to resolve the dispute informally within 45 days of receiving the notice. If resolution isn’t reached, arbitration can be initiated.</p>

                    <h3>2. Arbitration Process:</h3>
                    <p>Arbitration will be the exclusive remedy for resolving disputes. You and SheDrives are waiving the right to litigate disputes in court and agreeing to resolve disputes through a neutral arbitrator.</p>
                    <p><b>Procedures:</b> Procedures not addressed by the Agreement or Rules will be resolved by agreement or by the arbitrator. Statutes of limitation applicable in court will also apply in arbitration. The arbitrator’s decision is final, and the award can be enforced in any court with jurisdiction.</p>


                    <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">General Provisions</h2>
                    <p><b>1. Enforcement:</b>Any disputes regarding the formation, applicability, meaning, or enforceability of the Agreement are subject to arbitration.</p>

                    <p><b>4. No Modification:</b>This Agreement can only be modified in writing with mutual consent from both parties.</p>
                    <p><b>5. Dispute Resolution for Mass Arbitrations:</b>Mass Arbitrations Definition: If 100 or more arbitration demands asserting similar disputes are made against SheDrives within a rolling 52-week period, SheDrives can notify you and the arbitrator, and the arbitration proceedings will be stayed while SheDrives seeks a court determination.</p>
                    <p><b>Court Determination: </b>If a court determines that the arbitration demands are mass arbitrations, they will be litigated in court instead of arbitration.</p>
                    <p><b>Jurisdiction:</b>If you are part of a mass arbitration, you consent to the jurisdiction of any court where SheDrives seeks a determination on mass arbitrations.</p>
                    <p>This Agreement is intended to replace the right to go to court, including the right to a jury trial and participation in class or representative actions.</p>

            <div class="text-left mt-4 terms-text px-3">
                <p>The Community Guidelines were created to ensure that all users of the SheDrives platform experience a secure and respectful environment.
                   These guidelines are integrated into SheDrives' Terms of Use and form part
                   of the agreement between you and SheDrives. They apply to all users of our platform.</p>

                <p>These guidelines encompass rules outlined in our Safety Pact, and any violation may result in losing access to the SheDrives platform.
                   Consistently failing to meet the standards, or breaching rules and principles mentioned in these guidelines, directly undermines the
                   safety and integrity of the SheDrives platform and may lead to SheDrives taking action,
                   including temporarily or permanently suspending your account.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Community Guidelines Principles</h2>
                <p>We expect all our users to adhere to the following four principles:</p>
                <p>Complying with the law: We are committed to adhering to all laws and regulations where SheDrives operates, and we expect all
                    users to do the same.</p>
                <p>Delivering quality services: We strive to provide the best service for all users, and we expect all users to act accordingly.</p>
                <p><b>Treating everyone with respect: </b>We promote positive interactions among all users and expect our users to treat each other fairly, with respect and care.</p>
                <p><b>Prioritizing safety: </b>We value safety above all and expect all users to prioritize and support a secure environment.</p>
                <p>When all users of SheDrives abide by these principles, we maintain a quality-focused, healthy, and safe community for everyone, fulfilling our primary commitment to promoting social equity.</p>
                <p>To learn more about the rules, please visit the Safety Pact page on our website.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Content-Related Violations</h2>
                <p>Do not share illegal content: We do not permit the posting, sharing, or distribution of content that is illegal, such as materials related to child exploitation, or content that supports, coordinates, or glorifies terrorism and violent acts.</p>
                <p><b>Keep inappropriate content off SheDrives: </b>Do not share or display visuals that are sexually suggestive, such as objects, posters, cartoons, pictures, or drawings. Avoid making graphic comments, lewd remarks, sex-based epithets, obscene comments, derogatory remarks, sexually degrading words, slurs, sexual jokes, innuendo, or unwanted flirtations.
                    Refrain from commenting on an individual's body, sexual prowess, or deficiencies.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">What Happens if I Violate These Guidelines?</h2>
                <p>If you violate these guidelines, SheDrives may take the following actions:</p>
                <p><b>Warning: </b> You may receive a warning message.</p>
                <p><b>Temporary deactivation of your account: </b>Your access to your account may be temporarily suspended. You will be notified of the reason and duration of the suspension.</p>
                <p><b>Permanent deactivation of your account:</b>Your access to your account may be permanently suspended, and you will no longer be able to use the SheDrives platform.</p>
                <p><b>Incident reports to law enforcement:</b>: SheDrives will cooperate with law enforcement agencies in their investigations and provide all necessary and relevant information.</p>
                <p>When reviewing cases of guideline violations, SheDrives approaches each case individually. Actions taken are based on principles of fairness, ensuring that:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cases are dealt with promptly and effectively;</li>
                    <li>Users involved are kept informed of the process;</li>
                    <li>Cases are adequately investigated;</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Appropriate actions are implemented.</h2>
                <p>SheDrives will always notify users if they are at risk of any action. However, there are instances where SheDrives will implement actions without prior warning, such as when an automated suspension system is used, when reports or information require immediate legal or safety review, or when unlawful or fraudulent behavior is detected.</p>
                <p>All actions taken by SheDrives are subject to appeal by users to ensure fairness and protect against unjust or inaccurate reports and complaints.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Appeal Process</h2>
                <p>SheDrives uses data and platform information to identify and address safety issues. Users are always given the opportunity to request a human review either before a decision is made or after it is enforced (an appeal). This ensures that users are treated fairly and that their accounts aren’t impacted by fraudulent reports. All actions are subject to appeal by the user.</p>
                <p>It should also be noted that if a user has been affected by an action due to a low rating (3 stars or less) or a series of negative reviews and ratings, they can appeal the decision. The appeal will be reevaluated if the user provides substantial evidence that the low rating and reviews were the result of unsubstantiated reports, including but not limited to discrimination or other reasons unrelated to the user's behavior.</p>
                <p>SheDrives will always inform drivers and clients if they are at risk of any action against them. However, there are occasions when SheDrives will take action against users without prior notice, such as when reports or information necessitate immediate legal or safety review, or when SheDrives determines that a user has engaged in unlawful or fraudulent behavior, as required by applicable laws and regulations.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Remediation Option</h2>
                <p>If a user who has allegedly violated these guidelines wishes to rectify the situation, they may do so if both parties involved in the incident agree and communicate with SheDrives. We may then review the case and potentially cancel actions taken against such users.</p>
                <p>Any remediation review will depend on:</p>
                <p>The type of violation;</p>
                <p>Whether the damage done can be repaired;</p>
                <p>A case-by-case analysis.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">Why to Take a Selfie?</h2>
                <p>Ensuring the safety of our users is our highest priority. In certain areas, we request that your
                     complete liveness checks to help us confirm that you are a genuine person. Additionally, we may perform identity verification to prevent the use of our services by individuals who may pose a risk.
                     These checks also help secure your account and prevent identity theft.</p>
                <p>We appreciate your cooperation and support in making SheDrives a safer platform for everyone.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">How to Take a Selfie?</h2>
                <p>When prompted, take a real-time image of yourself using the app, following the on-screen instructions. The instructions will be provided as text and animations. If the real-time image is of you,
                   the verification process should be smooth, allowing you to place your first order.</p>
                <h3>Key Tips:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you are in a well-lit area</li>
                    <li>Ensure your face and neck are within the white frame lines</li>
                    <li>Keep your eyes uncovered</li>
                    <li>Avoid wearing a mask, hat, or sunglasses</li>
                    <li>Hold your phone steady at arm’s length to prevent blurriness</li>
                    <li>Do not capture an existing photo or an image of someone/something else</li>
                    <p>It’s essential that you capture a real-time photo of yourself and not a photo of an existing image or someone else, as this will result in a failed verification.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">How Often Will I Be Asked to Complete a Liveness Check?</h2>
                <p>You will only be asked to complete the liveness check once. If you’ve already passed this check but are being prompted again,
                   it might be because you completed it on a different account.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">How Is My Photo Processed and Stored?</h2>
                <p>When you take a selfie in the app, we receive it and share it with our liveness check service provider. Our provider has assured us that they do not store any photos after the liveness check processing is complete.
                    All photos are securely stored on our servers, and we do not share your photo with other users.</p>
                <p>To protect your account’s security, we will retain your photo as long as you maintain an account with us, in accordance with local laws and our Privacy Policy. After this period, your photo will be deleted.</p>
                <p>We may disclose your photo for legal reasons, as outlined in our Privacy Policy.</p>

                <p>Welcome to Courier!</p>
                <p>These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the Courier service within the SheDrives Only mobile applications, websites, products, content, facilities, and platform (collectively, the “Platform”).</p>
                <p>These Courier Terms of Use are an integral part of the General Terms of Use. By using the Courier service, you express your full agreement with these Terms and the General Terms of Use. In case of any conflict
                   or inconsistency between the provisions of these Terms and the General Terms of Use, the provisions of these Terms will apply.</p>
                <p>You form a contract with us when you confirm that you accept these Terms or when you otherwise use the Platform. The company that you are contracting with depends on where you are resident.
                   In the Pakistan, your contract is with SHEDRIVES XIX of 2017</p>
                <p>Your use of the Platform as a Courier may be subject to designated Driver Terms of Use. Our privacy practices are described in Privacy Policy.</p>


                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">1. Business model of Courier</h2>
                <p>Our Platform connects independent third-party providers of courier services (“Couriers”) and their clients (“Clients,” which could be either senders or recipients of the courier services) with each other. When Clients request a delivery of the Parcel, they offer their price for the Courier’s services.
                   The Couriers who see the request can either agree to the offered price or make a counteroffer.</p>
                <p>The Client must pay the Courier the price that both parties agreed on via the Platform. This agreed price includes all charges associated with the transportation of the Parcel (including but not limited to fees, tolls, levies, taxes, etc.).
                   SheDrives Only does not participate and does not in any way affect the price agreed between the Courier and the Client.</p>


                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">2. Client’s Responsibility</h2>
                <p>You, as the Client, are responsible for providing accurate and complete information about the delivery, including the correct point of delivery address of the Parcel, contact information, and any special instructions necessary for the successful delivery of the Parcel.</p>
                <p>You undertake to ensure unhindered passage for the Courier to the place of delivery, as well as to ensure their presence or the presence of a third party capable of accepting the Parcel at the place of the specified delivery address.</p>
                <p>If you are a sender, you are responsible for ensuring that the Parcel is properly packed and protected for transportation. Any damages or delays resulting from inadequate packaging or incorrect delivery information provided by you will be your sole responsibility.</p>
                <p>If you are a sender, you should not send for delivery any Parcel exceeding 22 lbs. (10 kg) for couriers (walking courier, bicycle courier, motorcycle courier).</p>
                <p>You represent and warrant that you have the legal right to possess and send the items included in the Parcel. You are responsible for ensuring that the items being sent are lawfully acquired and not in violation of any applicable laws, regulations, or restrictions.</p>
                <p>You acknowledge that you bear full responsibility for any legal consequences or claims that may arise due to sending goods without proper ownership or authorization.</p>


                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">3. Courier’s Responsibility</h2>
                <p>You, as the Courier, are responsible for the safe and timely transportation of the Parcel from the point of collection to the point of delivery. You must take all necessary precautions to prevent any loss or damage to the Parcel during transportation. In the event of any loss or damage to the Parcel while in your possession, you will be held liable, subject to any limitations or exclusions of liability provided under these Terms or applicable law.</p>
                <p>Both parties acknowledge that each party's responsibility for the delivery is limited to the respective obligations set forth above, and neither party shall be held liable for any failure or delay in the delivery caused by circumstances beyond their reasonable control, including, but not limited to, natural disasters, governmental actions, or any other force majeure events.</p>
                <p>In the event of an unsuccessful delivery due to the Client’s unavailability, incorrect delivery information provided by the Client, or any other reason beyond the Courier's reasonable control, SheDrives Only does not take responsibility for storing the Parcel. The sender and the recipient should be aware that in such cases, they must make alternative arrangements for the Parcel's storage or handling.</p>

                    <li>Carefully read its contents</li>
                    <li>Ask the sender to show the contents and seal the package with you</li>
                    <li>Do not accept the Parcel if the sender refuses to show the contents, or if the contents seem suspicious or illegal.</li>
                    <li>If the Client suspects a violation of the current legislation or these Terms, you may contact us via [SheDrives support].</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="mt-4 mb-2">4. Restricted Goods</h2>
